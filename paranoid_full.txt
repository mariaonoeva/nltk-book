Please could you stop the noise?
I'm tryna get some rest
From all the unborn chicken
Voices in my head
What's that? (I may be paranoid, but not an android)
What's that? (I may be paranoid, but not an android)
When I am king
You will be first against the wall
With your opinion
Which is of no consequence at all
What's that? (I may be paranoid, but no android)
What's that? (I may be paranoid, but no android)
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La, la
Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking, squealing, Gucci little piggy
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la
You don't remember, you don't remember
Why don't you remember my name?
Off with his head, man, off with his head, man
Why don't you remember my name?
I guess he does
Ah, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
that's it, sir, you're leaving
The crackle of pigskin (rain down)
(Come on rain down) the dust and the screaming
The yuppies networking
The panic, the vomit (from a great height)
The panic, the vomit (from a great height)
God loves his children
God loves his children, yeah
