Exercises from NLTK with Python book solved by me

Hi, this repo is dedicated to NLTK with Python book (https://www.nltk.org/book/). I upload here my answers to the exercises and try some code from the chapters. I don't promise the answers are correct, but I tried. 

Important: I use Jupiter notebooks and not plain Python. It's more convenient for me and looks prettier. Some code outputs are long and that's how it is, sorry. 

I code locally using PyCharm and push these notebooks here. JetBrains kindly provides the license for students, just login using GitHub. GitHub Pro is also available for students for free (school confirmation is required). 

#### Mentioned stuff: 
- Jupiter Notebooks https://jupyter.org/
- JetBrains license for students https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students
- GitHub Pro for students https://education.github.com/pack

Hope I didn't share anything I didn't want to share in the notebooks. In case of any questions, feel free to contact me somehow.
